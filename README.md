# PIP
## Exercise 1
### Exercise 1a
Launch the terminal. By using the file library.txt, install the libraries in the versions listed there.

Tip This can be done in at least two ways: by installing each dependency in turn with the pip install command specifying the required version of the library at the time of entering the command or by specifying the path to the file library.txt with the appropriate switch -r (file should be treated as requirements.txt - the name does not matter here).

```bash
pip install -r .\libraries.txt
```

### Exercise 1b

Check for newer versions for installed libraries.

```bash
pip list -o
```

### Exercise 1c

Look for information about installed libraries, find out what they provide for the project (look particularly at the ipython library).

Pokud chceme aktualizovat všechny balíčky najedou, pak můžeme využít pip-review:
```bash
pip install pip-review
```

Seznam všech balíčků, které lze aktualizovat:
```bash
pip-review
```

Balíčky můžeme aktualizovat postupně interaktivně:
```bash
pip-review --local --interactive
```

Případně všechny najednou:
```bash
pip-review --local --auto
```

## Exercise 2
### Exercise 2a

Look in the pip library for pylint.

https://pypi.org/project/pylint/

### Exercise 2b

Install the pylint library in the version extracted from the previous step.

Tip To install dependencies in a specific version, you must add the == operator along with the library version in addition to the traditional installation command.
```bash
pip install pylint==3.1.0
```

### Exercise 2c

Search the internet and find out what you can use this library for.

### Exercise 2d

Select one of your previously created python files and check its correctness using the pylint (command: pylint <path_to_file>). If there are any suggestions, please make corrections; try until the result is 10/10.

Tip pylint will analyze the code and evaluate how it was formatted and written. In the case of bad non-Python-style names or unnecessary blank lines, the result will be worse (there are many more rules, it is worth knowing a substantial part of them). For a 10/10 result, the library considers the file to be fully valid.

## Exercise 3
### Exercise 3a

Check what libraries are currently installed on your computer; redirect the result to a file.

Tip The result of the first command can be redirected to a file using the redirection operator on operating systems: >.
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Exercise 3b

What is the difference between the ```pip list``` and ```pip freeze``` commands? Can the formats generated by both commands be successfully used (after being redirected to a file) to install the dependency package in the new project?

Tip Try to redirect the result of both commands (pip list and pip freeze) to a file and install dependencies referring to this file. See what the commands generated.

## Exercise 4
### Exercise 4a

Uninstall the previously installed jedi library.
```bash
pip uninstall jedi
```

### Exercise 4b

Uninstall the other libraries you no longer need -> optional.

Tip As with the pip install command, you can use the requirements.txt file to uninstall dependencies.
